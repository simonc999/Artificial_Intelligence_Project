# Artificial_Intelligence_Project

This repository contains a project focused on decision support in medicine, specifically related to decisions regarding the Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) guideline, a sleep disorder that is still underdiagnosed and highly prevalent. The modeling process is divided into three steps: the first step involves using the "Protege" software to model knowledge, the second step utilizes the "Composer" software to model a typical flow or one with complications, and the third step employs "YAWL" along with Java-written codelets to model Petri nets used for implementing the workflow of the guideline.
